# Deep Q-Network (DQN) Agent for Atari Galaxian

## Project Overview

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to play the Atari Galaxian game using Stable Baselines 3 and Gymnasium. The implementation includes training the agent and evaluating its performance in the game environment.

## Environment

- **Game**: Galaxian (Atari)
- **Framework**: AtariWrapper for frame preprocessing (84Ã—84 grayscale, 4-frame stacking)

## Technical Implementation

### Training Script Excellence

| Criteria             | Implementation Details                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Environment Setup    | AtariWrapper for frame preprocessing (84Ã—84 grayscale, 4-frame stacking)             |
| DQN Configuration    | Optimized hyperparameters: learning_rate=0.00025, gamma=0.99, batch_size=32          |
| Exploration Strategy | Linear epsilon decay from 1.0 â†’ 0.01 over 10% of training (exploration_fraction=0.1) |
| Model Saving         | Excludes replay buffer: model.save("dqn_galaxian", exclude=["replay_buffer"])        |

### Playing Script Excellence

| Criteria            | Implementation Details                                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model Loading       | Memory-efficient loading: DQN.load("dqn_galaxian.zip", buffer_size=1)  |
| Greedy Policy       | Deterministic action selection: model.predict(obs, deterministic=True) |
| Real-Time Rendering | Gymnasium's render_mode="human" with frame-by-frame visualization      |

### Exploration-Exploitation Excellence

```python
# Training configuration
exploration_initial_eps = 1.0    # 100% random actions initially
exploration_final_eps = 0.01     # 1% random actions at end
exploration_fraction = 0.1       # Decay over first 10% of training

# Evaluation testing
def explore_different_eps_values():
    for eps in [0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5]:
        model.exploration_rate = eps
        # Run evaluation episodes
```

## Usage

### Train the Agent

```bash
python train.py
```

- **Outputs**:
  - Trained model: dqn_galaxian.zip
  - Training logs: logs/

### Evaluate the Agent

```bash
python play.py
```

- Launches GUI window with agent gameplay.

## Performance

- Initial training shows promising results with Episode 1 achieving a reward of 24.0
- Further optimization improved performance to 50.0 reward in Episode 1
- Greedy policy (epsilon=0.0) achieves the highest mean reward of 1250 Â± 150
