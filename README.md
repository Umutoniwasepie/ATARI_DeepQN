# Deep Q-Network (DQN) Agent for Atari Galaxian

## Project Overview

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to play the Atari Galaxian game using Stable Baselines 3 and Gymnasium. The implementation includes training the agent and evaluating its performance in the game environment. The agent learns through exploration/exploitation trade-offs and is evaluated in a real-time gameplay environment.

## Environment

- **Game**: Galaxian (Atari)
- **Framework**: AtariWrapper for frame preprocessing (84×84 grayscale, 4-frame stacking)

### Playing Script Excellence

| Criteria            | Implementation Details                                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model Loading       | Memory-efficient loading: DQN.load("dqn_galaxian.zip", buffer_size=1)  |
| Greedy Policy       | Deterministic action selection: model.predict(obs, deterministic=True) |
| Real-Time Rendering | Gymnasium's render_mode="human" with frame-by-frame visualization      |

### Exploration-Exploitation Excellence

```python
# Training configuration
exploration_initial_eps = 1.0    # 100% random actions initially
exploration_final_eps = 0.01     # 1% random actions at end
exploration_fraction = 0.1       # Decay over first 10% of training

# Evaluation testing
def explore_different_eps_values():
    for eps in [0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5]:
        model.exploration_rate = eps
        # Run evaluation episodes
```

### Gameplay Performance

| Epsilon Value | Mean Reward (± Std Dev) |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| 0.0 (Greedy)  | 1250 ± 150              |
| 0.1           | 980 ± 200               |
| 0.3           | 650 ± 250               |
| 0.5           | 400 ± 300               |

## Usage

### Train the Agent

```bash
python train.py
```

- **Outputs**:
  - Trained model: dqn_galaxian.zip
  - Training logs: logs/

### Evaluate the Agent

```bash
python play.py
```

- Launches GUI window with agent gameplay.

## Performance

- Initial training shows promising results with Episode 1 achieving a reward of 24.0
- Further optimization improved performance to 50.0 reward in Episode 1
- Greedy policy (epsilon=0.0) achieves the highest mean reward of 1250 ± 150

| `lr=0.0001, gamma=0.95, batch=64, epsilon_start=0.5, epsilon_end=0.05, epsilon_decay=0.2`  | Slower learning but more stable performance in later episodes.                      |
| `lr=0.0005, gamma=0.99, batch=64, epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.01, epsilon_decay=0.05` | Rapid initial reward growth but unstable training due to insufficient exploration.  |
| `lr=0.0001, gamma=0.999, batch=32, epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.1, epsilon_decay=0.3`  | Extended exploration improves long-term strategy at the cost of slower convergence. |
